## 1. Voice Interaction Implementation

### 1.1 Speech-to-Text (STT) Architecture

**Dual Implementation Approach:**

We implemented a hybrid STT system using two complementary technologies:

#### **Browser-Based Real-Time Transcription (Web Speech API)**
- **Technology**: Web Speech API (`webkitSpeechRecognition`)
- **Use Case**: Real-time voice input for job descriptions and focus areas
- **Location**: Frontend JavaScript (`static/js/app.js`)
- **Key Features**:
  - Continuous recognition with interim results
  - Text appears in real-time as user speaks
  - Accumulated transcription (doesn't erase on pause)
  - No backend processing required
  - Zero API costs

**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
recognition.continuous = true;      // Keep listening
recognition.interimResults = true;  // Show partial results
recognition.lang = 'en-US';

recognition.onresult = function(event) {
    // Accumulate final transcripts
    // Show interim results in real-time
};
```

**Why Web Speech API?**
- **Cost**: Completely free, no API calls
- **Latency**: Real-time feedback (~50-100ms)
- **User Experience**: Users see text as they speak
- **Limitations**: Browser-dependent (Chrome/Edge best, Safari limited, Firefox unsupported)

#### **Server-Based Transcription (OpenAI Whisper)**
- **Technology**: OpenAI Whisper (base model)
- **Use Case**: Fallback for recorded audio, offline transcription
- **Location**: Backend Python (`voice/stt_handler.py`)
- **Key Features**:
  - High accuracy offline transcription
  - No internet required after model download
  - Supports multiple audio formats
  - Language detection and translation

**Implementation Details:**
```python
import whisper

class SpeechToTextHandler:
    def __init__(self, model_size="base"):
        self.model = whisper.load_model(model_size)
    
    def transcribe_audio_file(self, audio_file_path):
        result = self.model.transcribe(
            audio_file_path,
            fp16=False,      # CPU compatibility
            language='en',   # Faster with language hint
        )
        return result["text"]
```

**Why OpenAI Whisper?**
- **Cost**: Free (open-source, runs locally)
- **Accuracy**: State-of-the-art transcription quality
- **Privacy**: All processing happens locally
- **Flexibility**: Supports 99+ languages
- **Model Size**: Base model (~140MB) balances speed vs. accuracy

**System Dependencies:**
- **FFmpeg**: Audio format conversion and processing
- **PortAudio**: Audio input/output device management

### 1.2 Text-to-Speech (TTS) Architecture

**Graceful Fallback System:**

We implemented a primary-fallback TTS architecture to ensure voice output always works, even when API quotas are exceeded.

#### **Primary: OpenAI TTS API**
- **Model**: `tts-1` (fast, optimized for real-time)
- **Voice**: `nova` (female, warm and friendly)
- **Location**: Backend Python (`voice/tts_handler.py`)

**Implementation:**
```python
import openai

class TextToSpeechHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
        self.voice = "nova"
        self.model = "tts-1"
    
    def text_to_speech(self, text, voice="nova"):
        try:
            response = self.client.audio.speech.create(
                model=self.model,
                voice=voice,
                input=text,
                response_format="mp3"
            )
            audio_data = response.content
            return base64.b64encode(audio_data).decode('utf-8')
        except Exception as e:
            # Fallback to Google TTS
            return self._google_tts_fallback(text)
```

**Why OpenAI TTS?**
- **Quality**: Most natural-sounding voice
- **Latency**: Fast generation (~1-2 seconds for typical responses)
- **Voices**: 6 high-quality voice options
- **Customization**: Control over pitch, speed, emotion

**Cost Considerations:**
- **Pricing**: $15.00 / 1M characters (tts-1 model)
- **Example**: 1000 interview responses (~500 words each) = ~$7.50
- **Quota Issues**: Free tier has limited quota

#### **Fallback: Google TTS (gTTS)**
- **Technology**: gTTS library (Google Text-to-Speech)
- **Trigger**: Automatic when OpenAI fails (quota/error)
- **Location**: Same handler (`voice/tts_handler.py`)

**Implementation:**
```python
from gtts import gTTS
import io

def _google_tts_fallback(self, text):
    print("ðŸ”„ Falling back to Google TTS...")
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en', slow=False)
    audio_buffer = io.BytesIO()
    tts.write_to_fp(audio_buffer)
    audio_buffer.seek(0)
    audio_data = audio_buffer.read()
    return base64.b64encode(audio_data).decode('utf-8')
```

**Why Google TTS as Fallback?**
- **Cost**: Completely free
- **Reliability**: No quota limits
- **Quality**: Acceptable voice quality (slightly robotic)
- **No Setup**: No API key required

**Fallback Strategy Benefits:**
- Users never see "TTS unavailable" errors
- Seamless transition (user might not notice)
- Development-friendly (works without API keys)
- Cost-effective for testing and demos
